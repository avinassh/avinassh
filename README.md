### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I work as a backend developer at [Verloop](https://github.com/verloop) (we are [hiring](https://verloop-team.freshteam.com/jobs))
- I mostly code in Go, and Python
- I am interested in distributed systems, message queues, and messaging infrastructure in general
- I am also learning Rust these days

I contribute to open source a lot and following projects are my current focus:

- [gRPC Errors](https://github.com/avinassh/grpc-errors)
- [twirpy](https://github.com/verloop/twirpy)
- [Fast SQLite Inserts](https://github.com/avinassh/fast-sqlite3-inserts)
- [fluvio-go](https://github.com/avinassh/fluvio-go)
- [pastry](https://github.com/avinassh/pastry)
- [grusto](https://github.com/avinassh/grusto)

Here are my two recent blog posts:

- [Towards Inserting One Billion Rows in SQLite Under A Minute](https://avi.im/blag/2021/fast-sqlite-inserts/)
- [I ended up adding duplicate records on a unique index in MongoDB](https://avi.im/blag/2021/mongo-dupes-in-unique-index/)
